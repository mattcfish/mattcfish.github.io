Nothing to see here, just a dad of 3, senior engineer/architect, remote worker, ameteur investor.  Life is busy, but that is all the more reason to make space to write things down. 

I live in the Dallas area with the wife, 2 daughters, and brand new son.  I have worked 100% remote for the past 7 years and dont think I will ever go back to full time office work.  

I dont really do social media, but that might change.
